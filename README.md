# HypixelCalculator
## This tool is useful to help determine how long it will take to reach a specified goal of items using only Hypixel's skyblock minions.


## Usage
- First field is the type of minion you are using.
- The next 11 fields are the amount of minions per minion level that you have.
- The final field is the amount of blocks you want to aquire from using the minions.
- Click calculate to get the estimated time it will take for just the minions to reach the desired amount of blocks.

## Known inaccuracies
- This program ignores minion setup time, so the time it takes for an emerald minion to place the first 24 emeralds is not included in the final result.
- There was no surefire way for to calculate the exact number of items that will drop from plants, such as melons or cocoa beans, and mobs, so the most common amount I got from manually farming is what I used in its place. If anyone has a more accurate way to calculate these items, feel free to contribute.
