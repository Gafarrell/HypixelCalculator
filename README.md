# HypixelCalculator
Simple minion calculator for Hypixel's Skyblock mode

## Some known inaccuracies
- Due to random amounts per mob kill and specific ores like lapis or redstone, not all calculations are %100 accurate.
- Minion setup time is not included, minion setup time meaning the first few actions it takes for the minion to place the initial blocks.
- Fuel is not accounted for, but some simple math shown below can help remedy this problem.

## What the creator has to say
This program was made in my own free time as an on-the-spot tool to help make a quick estimate at how long it will take a certain amount of minions to reach a goal of blocks/items. If anyone finds bugs in this program please feel free to alert me and I will fix them as soon as possible, if you are a programmer and know how to fix them yourself, feel absolutely free to do so, I will be on the lookout for pull requests, no specific instructions will be entailed for creating a pull request, I simply ask that you comment your changed code.

Enjoy the program, and I hope you find some use in it.
